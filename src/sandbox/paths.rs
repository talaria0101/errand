//! Whether a path stays inside the directory a session is confined to.
//!
//! One rule, used everywhere a path arrives from outside: from the agent, from
//! a delegation, from a chat message. A second rule written slightly
//! differently is how a containment check ends up being true in one place and
//! false in another.
//!
//! [`within`] answers about the spelling of a path. It cannot answer about a
//! symlink, because a name says nothing about what it points at, and between
//! asking and opening the answer can change. Anything the daemon actually
//! reads or writes on a session's behalf goes through [`open_beneath`], which
//! asks the kernel to enforce containment while it resolves.

//! The egress broker: the single endpoint a session in `proxy` mode may reach.
//!
//! A session's network namespace is locked so that the broker is the only
//! thing it can connect to. The broker then decides, per connection, whether
//! the host a session asked for is on the allowlist, and refuses everything
//! else. This is where egress stops being "any host on port 443" and becomes
//! "these hosts and no others", which is what keeps a session from dialing a
//! relay it does not need and turning an outbound allowance into a two-way
//! channel.
//!
//! A session speaks to it as an ordinary HTTP `CONNECT` proxy, so
//! `HTTPS_PROXY` is all a well-behaved client needs. The tunnel is opaque once
//! established: the broker gates on the host in the CONNECT line and then
//! copies bytes, it does not read inside the TLS. Credential injection for the
//! provider is a separate, terminating path, served on this module's second
//! listener; this file is the gate.

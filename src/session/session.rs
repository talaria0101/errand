//! One live session: a sandboxed agent, a project, and the surfaces watching.
//!
//! Everything a session does passes through here, which is why so little of it
//! is decided here. What may be typed and by whom is in `commands`, where a
//! path may point is in `sandbox::paths`, what a message looks like is in
//! `chat::render`. This is the lifecycle: start it, route what arrives, take a
//! turn, and tear it down exactly once.
//!
//! The session owns its state outright in one task, reached only through a
//! command channel; agent callbacks and scheduler wake-ups are signals on the
//! same channel, so nothing but the task itself touches the state.
